            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>This achievement is unlocked after defeating Great Grey Wolf Sif and acquiring the <strong>Covenant of
                    Artorias</strong> ring. This ring is required to traverse the Abyss and fight the Four Kings.</p>
            <p>Sif is located in <em>Darkroot Garden</em>, behind the locked gate that can be opened with the Crest of
                Artorias or through a back path from the Valley of Drakes.</p>

        <div class="guide-section">
            <h3>Steps to Acquire the Ring</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Purchase the <strong>Crest of Artorias</strong> from Andre of Astora (20,000 souls) OR take the
                    Valley of Drakes shortcut.</li>
                <li>Enter the sealed forest and proceed to the large arena past the forest hunters.</li>
                <li>Defeat Great Grey Wolf Sif in battle.</li>
                <li>After the battle, you will automatically receive the <strong>Covenant of Artorias</strong> ring.
                </li>

            <h3>Special Lore Note: Saving Sif (DLC)</h3>
            <p>If you complete the <em>Sanctuary Guardian</em>, <em>Artorias</em>, and <em>Manus</em> boss fights in the
                <strong>Artorias of the Abyss DLC</strong> before defeating Sif in the main game, you can rescue a
                younger Sif trapped behind Manus.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Later, when you return to fight Sif in Darkroot Garden, you will get a special cutscene â€” Sif will
                    recognize you and hesitate to fight.</li>
                <li>This is one of the most emotional moments in the game, reinforcing the tragic weight of the battle.
                </li>

            <h3>Lore: Artorias and the Abyss</h3>
            <p>The <strong>Covenant of Artorias</strong> ring was forged to allow Artorias to enter the Abyss without
                being consumed by it. Though he ultimately failed, the ring remains as proof of his valiant effort to
                hold back the darkness. You, the Chosen Undead, must carry on that burden to defeat the Four Kings.</p>
