            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The Princess's Guard covenant is a faith-based group devoted to the protection of <strong>Gwynevere,
                    Princess of Sunlight</strong>. It is ideal for players focused on healing and support-based miracles
                in co-op play.</p>
            <p>You can join immediately after defeating Ornstein and Smough in Anor Londo. Once you access the chamber
                behind the boss fog gate, speak with Gwynevere and accept her offer to join the covenant.</p>
        </div>

            <h3>Additional Information: Gwynevere</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Joining the covenant immediately unlocks the <em>Soothing Sunlight</em> and <em>Bountiful
                        Sunlight</em> miracles in her shop.</li>
                <li>Gwynevere is a projection created by Gwyndolin, but this illusion persists unless the player
                    disrupts it (see lore details below).</li>
                <li>This covenant, like the Way of White, does not use a ranking system.</li>
                <li><strong>Note:</strong> Breaking the illusion (by attacking Gwynevere or entering Gwyndolin’s boss
                    room) will also break the covenant.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What Are Covenants?</h3>
            <p>Covenants in <em>Dark Souls</em> are like factions or alliances that your character can join. Each one
                has its own theme, tiered reward structure, and impact on both single-player and online gameplay.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Some covenants are focused on co-op and helping other players.</li>
                <li>Others are more PvP-oriented, encouraging invasions or duels.</li>
                <li>Each covenant offers different spells, equipment, or story interactions as rewards for your loyalty.
                </li>
                <li>Each covenant will require items to reach higher ranks (higher ranks unlock better rewards), but
                    most covenants require different items.</li>
                <li><strong>Note:</strong> You can only be in one covenant at a time. Leaving or <em>betraying</em> a
                    covenant can have consequences.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The <strong>Princess's Guard</strong> is useful for co-op-focused builds, especially for miracle users
                looking to support others online. Unlike many other covenants, it does not emphasize PvP or ranking
                progression.</p>

            <h3>Lore: The Illusion of Light</h3>
            <p>Gwynevere, as seen in Anor Londo, is not truly present in Lordran. She is an illusion created by
                <strong>Dark Sun Gwyndolin</strong> to preserve the illusion of divine rule after the fall of the gods.
            </p>
            <p>This illusion, while benevolent, is a facade that keeps Anor Londo bathed in light. Striking her or
                discovering the truth about Gwyndolin plunges the city into darkness and reveals its true, abandoned
                state.</p>
            <p>Despite this, many faithful—including the Princess's Guard—devote themselves to her image, protecting
                what she represents: hope, sunlight, and divine protection.</p>
