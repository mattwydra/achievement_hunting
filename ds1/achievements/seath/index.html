            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Seath the Scaleless is one of the four major Lords you must defeat to progress the story after obtaining
                the Lordvessel.</p>
            <p>This fight involves a unique setup where you must die once before being able to truly defeat him. The
                actual boss fight is located deep in the Duke's Archives and the Crystal Cave.</p>

            <h3>How to Reach Seath</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>After placing the Lordvessel, warp to <em>Anor Londo</em> and head to the large rotating staircase
                    tower.</li>
                <li>Proceed through the upper hallways to reach <strong>Duke's Archives</strong>.</li>
                <li>Fight through waves of enemies including Channelers and Crystal Soldiers.</li>
                <li>In your first encounter with Seath (unavoidable loss), you are cursed and placed in a prison cell.
                </li>
                <li>Escape the prison and return through the Archives and into the <strong>Crystal Cave</strong> to face
                    the real boss fight.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h3>Boss Strategy: Seath the Scaleless</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Before damaging Seath, destroy the <strong>Primordial Crystal</strong> at the back of the room.
                    Until it is broken, Seath is invincible.</li>
                <li>Seath’s attacks include crystal breath, tail swipes, and a devastating curse-inflicting AoE.</li>
                <li>
                    Tips for survival:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Equip armor or rings that increase Curse Resistance, such as the <em>Cursebite Ring</em>.
                        </li>
                        <li>Stay behind or to the sides to avoid his breath attacks.</li>
                        <li>Seath’s tail can be cut off to receive the <em>Moonlight Greatsword</em>, but this is risky.
                        </li>
                        <li>Watch for his crystal AoE explosion and back away as soon as he rears up.</li>
                        <li><strong>Note:</strong> The floor is slippery and cramped with crystals. Move carefully to
                            avoid falling off the platform.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Lore: Seath the Scaleless</h3>
            <p>Seath was a pale, scaleless albino dragon who betrayed his own kind during the Age of Ancients. Lacking
                the immortality granted by scales, he allied with Gwyn and was rewarded with a dukedom and a shard of a
                Lord Soul.</p>
            <p>His obsession with immortality and sorcery led him to madness, ultimately making him a danger to all. He
                experimented on people within the Duke's Archives, corrupting them into grotesque, crystalized forms.
            </p>
            <p>Despite being blind, Seath developed the art of crystal sorcery, influencing much of the magic system in
                the world of Dark Souls.</p>
