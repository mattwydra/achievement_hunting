            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Nito, the first of the dead, is one of the four Lords and a required boss to progress in the game's main quest. Defeating him allows you to offer his soul to the Lordvessel.</p>
            <p>You will need to traverse the Catacombs and the Tomb of the Giants—two of the darkest and trickiest areas in the game. Getting to Nito can be more frustrating than the boss himself.</p>

            <h3>Additional Information</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You must first defeat Pinwheel in the Catacombs to gain the <em>Rite of Kindling</em> and access to the Tomb of the Giants.</li>
                <li>A light source (Skull Lantern, Sunlight Maggot, or Cast Light spell) is essential for navigating the Tomb of the Giants.</li>
                <li>You’ll need the Lordvessel to access Nito’s fog gate. Upon acquiring it, warp to the Tomb of the Giants (Gravelord's Chamber bonfire).</li>
                <li>To enter Nito’s boss room, you must place the Lordvessel and offer the souls of the Four Lords.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Boss Strategy: Gravelord Nito</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Nito uses AoE attacks, including <em>Gravelord Sword Dance</em> and a deadly scream that causes AoE damage—distance management is key.</li>
                <li>His arena is filled with skeletons, including large ones. Lure Nito toward you to trigger his AoE and kill the mobs for you, or use a Divine weapon to kill them permanently.</li>
                <li>Stay close to Nito to bait his melee attacks rather than magic, but avoid crowding too tightly to reduce AoE risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Note:</strong> It’s possible to avoid waking the larger skeletons near the walls if you hug the left side when entering.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Lore: The First of the Dead</h3>
            <p>Gravelord Nito was one of the original Lords who acquired a Lord Soul during the Age of Ancients. He is the embodiment of death and decay, spreading miasma and disease across the land.</p>
            <p>Though a fearsome figure, Nito does not seek conquest like the other Lords. He instead rules over death in quiet solemnity. His covenant, the <a href="covenant-gravelord-servant.html">Gravelord Servants</a>, serve this role by spreading death and curses across other worlds.</p>
            <p>Nito's domain is as much about entropy as it is about balance—the return of all things to the dark. His presence is haunting, but more passive than actively malicious.</p>
